<h2>Stick Dude Likes Vitamin D</h2>

<h2>Defusal</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A simple game where the objective is to defuse the bomb before the time runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Intense and time-preassured.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Guessing/probability
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player must make guesses on the 4 digit defusal code and then cut the correct wire before the time runs out. Initial phase 
does not require the correct order while the final entry must be in order.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Figure out game states and different data structures in Phaser/js
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Keyboard and mouse inputs
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are the hero who needs to defuse a ticking bomb.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
none.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
~5 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Guesswork is the main strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>

<h2>Your game title</h2>
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/master
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A sidescroller which players stay alive by being in the right position on the screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
have a fun time with hardly any sort of time investment.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
2D sidescroller/platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player regains 'vitamin D' by staying under the sun which will move randomly around the map(implemented later).
Obstacles and simple puzzles will make this harder and harder as time goes by. If they lose all their vitamin D, the game ends.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Simple movement and sprite animation as well as a partial 3D background effect.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Powerups that enhance movement (to be implemented later), give the player several different ways to solve time constrainted puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
Stick dude is the hero who really enjoys being in the sun.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
none.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
casual gamers of all ages.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
~5 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
since you can move backwards faster than forwards, players will most likely utilize that to their advantage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All visual assets were made from scratch using MSPaint and Photoshop.
Audio assets were taken from http://phaser.io/examples/v2/audio/loop
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
<<<<<<< HEAD
Mario...? Not really though
